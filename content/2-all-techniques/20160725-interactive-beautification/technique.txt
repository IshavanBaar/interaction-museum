Title: Interactive Beautification

----

Description: 

Interactive Beautification is a object transformation technique. After an input, it beautifies your strokes according to geometric constraints. These are: 

- Connection
- Parallelism
- Perpendicularity
- Alignment
- Congruence
- Symmetry
- Interval

When there is an ambiguity in the created stroke, you can select from the derived candidates. With the technique, you can quickly create geometric diagrams.

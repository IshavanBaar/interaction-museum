Title: Link Jumping

----

Description: 

Link Jumping is a technique to navigate within groups of documents. Its first use was in 1968 in the NLS system.Links are connections between documents. One way to interact with links is to jump, moving from the link to the place it points to.  

When selecting a link, it is activated, and you jump to another part. The connections between the views can be hidden, or shown in a line diagram. On activation, there can be a visual or aural feedback.

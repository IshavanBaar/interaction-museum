Title: ThumbRock

----

Description: 

ThumbRock is a ready-to-use micro gesture that consists in rolling the thumb back and forth on the touchscreen. It can be recognized with 96% accuracy without calibration. ThumbRock can be either a quick, discrete gesture or a continuous roll on the touch surface. 

As a discrete gesture, ThumbRock can be used to navigate between screens while dragging and dropping a file or to navigate pages in a document. As a continuous roll, it can be used to scroll a document or to zoom in and out of Maps interfaces.

Title: Pick-and-Drop

----

Description: 

Pick-and-Drop is a direct manipulation technique. It extends drag-and-drop so that you can transfer objects using a pen. You touch an object to pick it up. If you hover the pen over the screen, the object floats under the pen, adding a shadow. You drop it by touching again.

You can transfer objects between multiple devices and users. For example, you pick up a video from a tablet, and drop it on a whiteboard. With a additional camera installation, you can move icons from paper to computer.

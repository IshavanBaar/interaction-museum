Title: Bubbling Menu

----

Description: 

A bubbling menu is a  (link: ../drop-down-menu text: Drop-Down Menus) menu with (link: ../bubble-cursor text: Bubble Cursor) selection. Additionally, there are directional mouse-gestures, so that it becomes faster to select frequently selected items, who are highlighted.

Unlike the Split Menu, the bubbling menu does not disrupt the original structure of menus.

Title: Drag-and-Drop

----

Description: Drang-and-Drop is one of the most popular direct manipulation techniques. The user can select an object by grabbing it and then dragging it to a different location or onto another object. It is commonly used for re-positioning objects and creating commands (e.g. set the color of the headphones). Drag-and-Drop is especially useful on touch-screen devices.

Title: Bubbling Menu

----

Description: 

A bubbling menu is a (link: ../drop-down-menu text: Drop-Down Menu) with (link: ../bubble-cursor text: Bubble Cursor) selection. Additionally you can use directional mouse-gestures to faster select frequently selected items, that are highlighted.

Unlike the Split Menu, the bubbling menu does not disrupt the original structure of menus.

Title: Selective Undo

----

Description: 

Selective undo allows people to reverse actions regardless of the order in which they happened. 

In the case of drawing applications, if you have changed the background color, you can draw a line and delete a polygon. Selective Undo allows you to delete the first action, changing the background color to the original one but keeping the line and the polygon actions.

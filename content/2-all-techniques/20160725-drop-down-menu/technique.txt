Title: Drop-Down Menu

----

Description: 

A drop-down or (cascading) pull-down menu shows, when opened, a list of commands or options. It can be fixed to the side of the screen, and contain nested items.

A drop-down menu first appeared on the Xerox Alto computer, as part of the WIMP interaction style. Since then, there have been many attempts to facilitate the access to the menu's (nested) items. Examples are the (link: ../bubbling-menu text: Bubbling Menu), (link: ../ephemeral-menu text: Ephemeral Menu), Force Field Menu and Motion Menu.

Title: Boomerang

----

Description: This is a “boomerang” technique, which makes it possible to suspend and resume drag-and-drop operations. A throwing gesture while dragging an object suspends the operation, anytime and anywhere. A drag-and-drop interaction enhanced with Boomerang allows users to switch windows, invoke commands, and even drag other objects during a drag-and-drop operation without using the keyboard or menus.
